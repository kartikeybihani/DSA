Recursion and backtracking

Steps to solve recursion problem -
  1) Find the base case
  2) Relation between problems and sub-problems
  3) Find general solution

Ques 1 - number of ways to find n*m matrix - base case if one of them is 1 - f(n-1,m) + f(m-1,n)
Ques 2 - Josephus problem - (f(n-1,k), k) % n

String recursion - 
1. Palindrome String
2. Print the powerset of a given string
3.
